# Analysing the Current Electric Car Market

**Can visualizing and analysing the current electric vehicle market in comparison to fossil fuel counterparts help me choose between the two?**

This is a question that I’ve wanted to address for a while as I have began entering the car market as a buyer and as an employee (analytics). When first getting a project ready, getting past the question and the technical direction the path will take, finding resources, doing preliminary research, and finding data can (and often do) take up a lot of time and energy of the process. In the past few weeks I have read through countless articles and projects that outline the current and future electric vehicle economy. From my initial observation, things seem promising and exiting in all corners of the market. But I want to see the numbers. I want to crunch the data, observe it, project predictions and make some observations of my own. This is where I was lead into the next phase of my project, gathering applicable data. 

Well, you may be surprised that gathering reliable applicable data can be painful and some of the things you need are just not found conveniently in a GitHub repository or on Kaggle’s website. I found three sources that I want to touch on, and then give credit to, for this project. 

1. The first data set I was after was a simple organized table of information that was ready to be read and cleaned on the current electric cars for sale (or pre-order). I found a perfect data set on the www.visualcapitalist.com website that I could copy over and use immediately. Perfect, data like this is awesome to find and is ready to go. Thank you for the hard work accumulating the information. 

2. I also wanted to get some other data sets that showed the current cost of electricity and fuel in the United States overtime. I found the best resource possible for this on the https://www.energy.gov/ department of energy’s website. It was a literal treasure trove of information and data sets. The only setback found here is the formatting of data takes some extra TLC as its in excel files and not standardized. Other than that, wonderful stuff. 

3. I wanted an equally expensive and specced fossil fuel vehicle to each of the electric cars on the market to show and honest cost and value comparison to an electric car. This data, took a lot more time and background domain knowledge. I, by hand, went to most current car manufacturers website and hand selected, researched, and recorded specifications and added them to a website. Time consuming? Absolutely. But, it was important to use my own mind and background knowledge on the cars available that rivaled those in the list.

Now that I have some data ready to go I can comfortably begin going into the set up and construction of my projects repository and workspace. I’ll post again when I have the beginnings of the project up and running.
